Hiring Manager
Complexio
Foundational AI

Dear Hiring Manager,
I am writing to express my strong interest in the DevOps Engineer position at Complexio. With my experience in deploying and
managing ML pipelines across multiple cloud environments and my extensive work with Kubernetes, I believe I can contribute
significantly to Complexio’s mission of automating business activities through AI solutions.
Currently pursuing my PhD in Computer Science at the University of East London, I have gained valuable hands-on experience in
managing distributed systems and implementing ML solutions at scale. As a Senior Research Assistant, I have:
   • Architected and managed multi-cloud ML pipelines across AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, processing 100,000+ data
      points daily
   • Successfully deployed and managed Kubernetes clusters for ML workloads, improving system reliability by 35%
   • Implemented robust CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions and Jenkins, reducing deployment time by 50%
   • Worked extensively with Neo4j and vector databases for efficient data management and similarity search
   • Developed and optimized data integration pipelines connecting multiple sources to centralized data lakes
I am particularly excited about Complexio’s focus on leveraging multiple LLMs and graph databases to understand and automate
business processes. My experience in managing GPU-accelerated ML workflows and optimizing distributed systems aligns perfectly
with your technical requirements. Additionally, my background in implementing secure data integration workflows compliant with
healthcare regulations demonstrates my understanding of handling sensitive data at scale.
While I may not meet the exact experience requirements of 7+ years in cloud infrastructure, my intensive hands-on experience
with cutting-edge technologies and proven track record of successfully implementing complex ML systems demonstrates my
capability to handle the responsibilities of this role effectively.
I am confident that my technical expertise, coupled with my research background in AI and distributed systems, would make me a
valuable addition to your team. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience align with Complexio’s
needs in more detail.
Thank you for considering my application.
Best regards,
Abin Zorto
