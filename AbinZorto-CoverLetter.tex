Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Data Scientist position within the Marketing Team at Wise. With my expertise in customer lifetime value modeling, causal inference, and marketing analytics, combined with strong Python development skills, I am excited about the opportunity to help Wise optimize its marketing efforts and drive global growth.

My experience aligns perfectly with Wise's needs. As a Senior Research Assistant, I have:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Developed and deployed customer LTV models processing millions of interactions, achieving 88\% prediction accuracy and enabling data-driven marketing decisions
    \item Built marketing mix models and causal inference frameworks to measure campaign effectiveness, identifying 30\% uplift in customer engagement
    \item Created scalable Python services using FastAPI and Docker, handling 50,000+ daily requests
    \item Collaborated with cross-functional teams to integrate ML solutions into existing business processes, enhancing customer insights and driving strategic decisions
\end{itemize}

I am particularly excited about Wise's mission to make money without borders the new normal. Your focus on data-driven decision making and autonomous work culture strongly appeals to me, and I believe my experience in building and maintaining marketing optimization models would allow me to make immediate contributions to your team.

The opportunity to work on projects that directly impact millions of customers while collaborating with talented analysts and marketers is exactly what I'm looking for in my next role. I would welcome the chance to discuss how my skills and experience align with Wise's needs in more detail.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,\\
Abin Zorto
