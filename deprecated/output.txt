Adolf Hitler is one of the most infamous figures in history and his role in World War II, particularly the Holocaust, has been
heavily studied. This essay will examine Adolf Hitler’s life from childhood to his rise to power as leader of Nazi Germany. It will
discuss the major events that led up to his ultimate downfall including the war itself and its consequences. Additionally, it will
explore how Hitler’s ideology helped shape modern society and what lessons can be learned from his impact on the world today.
Hitler was born in Austria in 1889 and initially trained as an artist but had little success with this endeavor. He moved to Munich
where he joined a German nationalist movement which ultimately brought him into contact with future Nazi leaders such as
Rudolf Hess and Ernst Rohm. In 1919, Hitler joined the German Workers’ Party (DAP) and by 1921 had become its leader
which was renamed the National Socialist German Workers’ Party (NSDAP). He was arrested in 1923 during a failed attempt to
overthrow Bavaria’s government but avoided prison due to political intervention.
